## Build and install 

In QtCreator project build settings (Build & Run -> selected Qt kit -> Build), add another make step with 'install' as an argument

## Run entire UI

After building the project, in QtCreator project run settings (Build & Run -> selected Qt kit -> Run), add a custom executable and select gosc_qqc2_calendar from:
```

The project has some errors that should be solved. Nevertheless it can be seen by choosing 'Yes' in the QtCreator's dialog asking whether we want to continue.
