Started implementation of the calendar in the branch `initial_calendar_fork`.

### 2019-05-28 - 2019-06-03

Tried to build the experimental calendar, got stuck on compile errors. The errors were present with either the official Ubuntu installation or a locally compiled Qt installation. Searched and asked for help online but didn't have much success because of the perplexing error messages. Solved with the help of the mentor, the existing installation files were interfering with the project. The solution was to fork the existing code and rename the project files accordingly so there are no conflicts.
